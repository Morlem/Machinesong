So I want to work on an online portfolio, but I'm not 100% confident about what goes there

It doesn't have to be perfect though, just good enough to get me a job
What work do I want to show off to get the kind of job I want?!

- MTI projects
   - real-time light painting
   - wax-drip

- CD projects
   - best of TMC projects
   - CDF
   - logos?

- BID
   - Letterboxer
   - Accelerate
   - BusFace--

What else seems like work I'm proud of?

- MTurk
- Methods HW
- Kinetic Type chat
- any good sketches?
- Oh snap! Pics on a map! (?)
- IxD Sem paper (X)
